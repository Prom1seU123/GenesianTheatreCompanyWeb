Love Letters,"By A.R. Gurney 
 Directed by Richard Cotter",2024-01-13,2024-01-28,"{""Director"": [""Richard Cotter""], ""Lighting Design"": [""Cian Byrne""]}","{""Stage Manager"": [""Mary Abraham"", ""Kayleigh Longuehaye"", ""Brooke McKenzie"", ""Amy Roberts""], ""Lighting Operation"": [""Gregory George""]}","{""Andrew Makepeace Ladd III"": [""Richard Cotter""], ""Melissa Gardner"": [""Tricia Youlden""]}","Andrew Makepeace Ladd III and Melissa Gardner, both born to wealth and position, are childhood friends whose lifelong correspondence begins with birthday party thank-you notes and summer camp postcards. Romantically attached, they continue to exchange letters through the boarding school and college years—where Andy goes on to excel at Yale and law school, while Melissa flunks out of a series of ""good schools.""
While Andy is off at war Melissa marries, but her attachment to Andy remains strong and she continues to keep in touch as he marries, becomes a successful attorney, gets involved in politics and, eventually, is elected to the U.S. Senate. Meanwhile, her marriage in tatters, Melissa dabbles in art and gigolos, drinks more than she should, and becomes estranged from her children.
The piece is comprised of letters exchanged over a lifetime between two people who grew up together, went their separate ways, but continued to share confidences. As the actors read the letters aloud, what is created is an evocative, touching, frequently funny but always telling pair of character studies in which what is implied is as revealing and meaningful as what is actually written down.",https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2024/1/images/poster.jpg,[]

Both are experiencing relationship troubles – Guy Haines reveals his wife has been unfaithful and he wants a divorce, Charles Bruno has been cut off by his wealthy father and wants to make him pay. Their lives on pause, Bruno offers a solution that could free them both: murder. But rather than each man killing their own targets, Bruno suggests they swap murders.

A brand new Shakespeare play has been discovered in a carpark in Leicester amidst some unimportant old bones. Written when the Bard was just a spotty 17 year old in Stratford, this thrilling manuscript seems to include the first drafts of all of his later body of work that we are familiar with today, all jumbled together in the one 100 hour play! Three Shakespearean enthusiasts have got their hands on the manuscript and are determined to present it to the good people of Sydney for the very first time ever!
Puck and Ariel battle it out in quest of the title of best fairy, Cleopatra falls for Eeyore's Bottom, Hamlet finds that Lady M is great at motivating him to be more of a 'to be' Hamlet instead of a 'not to be' Hamlet, while Lear's three daughters the weird sisters predict, incant, and prepare potions on a Scottish Moor. Since the full manuscript is over 100 hours, our gallant band may have to make some cuts during the performance, right before your eyes!",https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2021/1/images/poster.jpg,"['https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2021/1/images/1.jpg', 'https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2021/1/images/2.jpg', 'https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2021/1/images/3.jpg']"

A Passage to India
? This is a strong adaptation with many challenges of multiple locations, costume changes and large cast, but the timeless beauty of the story will shine through.
Before deciding whether to marry Chandrapore's local magistrate, Adela Quested desires discovering the ""real India"" for herself. Newly arrived from England, she agrees to see the Marabar Caves with the charming Dr Aziz. Through this one harmless event Forster exposes the absurdity, hysteria and depth of cultural ignorance that existed in British India in the twenties. E.M.

When first produced in the 1920's the play's twin themes of female sexual liberation and a casual attitude to marriage were ground breaking and perhaps before their time. The play was neglected for 90 years, until revived by Finborough Theatre just a few years ago in what was described as 'a splendid rediscovery' by British Theatre Guide. Now, for a modern 2020's audience it's the light and breezy writing of Coward that shines through, and in a post Me Too world people will be much more responsive to these themes.

A private crime becomes a public affair when Michael Starkwedder, a stranded motorist, stumbles across the body of Richard Warwick shot dead in his wheelchair, and his wife Laura standing in the shadows, clutching a revolver. Shaken, she confesses to the murder, but the more Michael hears of her boorish husband, the less inclined he is to believe that she is a cold blooded killer.
Taking a leap of faith, Michael risks implicating himself in the crime to help Laura conceal her involvement - an ingenious plan pins the crime on an untraceable enemy from the past, but now Michael and Laura must convince the rest of the household and the local police. Throw an excitable teenage boy, a suspicious valet, a nosey housekeeper and an ageing mother into the mix and the murder of Richard Warwick begs another question - who didn't have motive to kill him?

Under Milk Wood
 is an emotive and hilarious account of a spring day in a fictional Welsh seaside village. We learn of the inhabitants' dreams and desires, their loves and regrets. The play, closely associated with Richard Burton, was 'crowned with a storm of cheers' after its opening performance.
Under Milk Wood
 is like going 'Up the Garden Path' and 'Down the Rabbit Hole'. It has the beauty of your grandmother's garden, language that is eternal, and the strange reality you would find in Wonderland. The history of the town is rich and the characters are deep, quirky, and delightfully surprising. It is the town of 'Llareggub', which is 'bugger all' backwards. In
Under Milk Wood
 we follow their lives for a day and that is the beauty. The woman who lives with her two dead husbands, the blind sea captain who dreams of his love, Lily Smalls who stares at herself in a mirror... Dylan Thomas' characters reflect the beauty of how strange life can be and the joys and despairs of age and youth.
This piece by Dylan Thomas was said to give ""scope for all his versatility, for his gifts of humour and characterisation as well as his genius for poetry"".

Emma
 is a play about the stirrings of new love, and how sometimes by trying to manipulate Cupid's arrow, we can completely miss the mark!
We meet Emma, an accomplished and wealthy young woman, where after a successful attempt to bring two people together (Mr Weston & her Governess Miss Taylor), she believes herself a natural matchmaker. Emma's lesson to learn is that unlike playing with her dolls as a child, the people of Highbury are flesh and blood, and messing with their love lives can cause some real consequences!
Emma's latest project is Miss Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, who Emma takes under her wing, and coaches her to be amongst high society. Leading her affections away from an unworthy mate in Emma's eyes, and directing her towards a new suitor leads to unrequited love, broken hearts, and general confusion.

Figaro
, Charles Morey's new hit adaptation of
Le Mariage de Figaro
 by Beaumarchais, as 'Infectious' 'Tart' and 'Funny'! Often overshadowed by the Operatic version this hilarious romp remains tellingly relevant as Figaro himself explains ""I took up my pen and wrote a book everyone admired that offered the modest suggestion that the rich should pay more tax than the poor, speculators should be responsible for their own losses and government ministers should not accept gifts from wealthy merchants.""
Figaro, man servant to Count Almaviva, is engaged to Suzanne, maidservant to the Countess. The problem is that the Count, who has only been married 3 years himself, will not sign the marriage contract allowing the marriage to go ahead as he has ""other plans"" for Suzanne. A Figaro-ian scheme is needed to persuade the Count of his love for the Countess. But Suzanne and the Countess are dubious of its success and decide to take matters into their own hands. With lots of mistaken identities, broken promises, a love sick page, Antonio the gardeners melons, a birthmark in the shape of a spatula and lots of doors and letters, this hilarious romp set in late 18th century Spain highlights the difference in the class structure of the day.
When written in 1778

Far From the Madding Crowd
 was the subject of a popular film last year and we are thrilled to have obtained the rights to Mark Healy's recent stage adaptation for English Touring Theatre. The tale of a head-strong, feisty, yet ultimately compassionate woman and her three suitors, this acclaimed adaptation fuses vivid story-telling, live folk-song, and humour. Don't miss it!
Thomas Hardy's novels were concerned with the lives of country folk and the land. Set at the beginning of the industrial revolution,
Far From the Madding Crowd
 is perhaps foreshadowing the changes and social breakdown of country life in South West England; as the novel creates a sense of nostalgia for the traditional way of life - despite its harshness and hardships.
Mark Healy's close adaptation of the narrative was commissioned by the English Touring Theatre in 2008 and toured extensively during that year. Healy recognised that much of early nineteenth century writing tends to be melodramatic, and with so much drama happening within the story he focussed on showing as much of the day-to-day life of the individuals by grounding the play in authentic activities.

Three Sisters
 probes the lives and dreams of Olga, Masha, and Irina, former Muscovites now living in a provincial town from which they long to escape. Their hopes for a life more suited to their cultivated tastes and sensibilities provide a touching counterpoint to the relentless flow of compromising events in the real world.
In this powerful play, a landmark of modern drama, Chekhov masterfully interweaves character and theme in subtle ways that make the work's climax seem as inevitable as it is deeply moving.
For this Genesian production, our very experienced director Timothy Bennett has chosen to use
Brian Friel's
 highly regarded 1981 translation of Chekhov's play. This beautifully lyrical translation brings the piece to life for a modern English speaking audience, with Friel's deft touch and intelligent use of language highlighting Chekhov's wonderful writing.

A prodigy who composed his first concerto at four, his first symphony at five. Undeniable musical brilliance, charm and verve: this is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Antonio Salieri, court composer to the Emperor Joseph II, is a prolific young man at the Hapsburg court. Leading a virtuous life, he expects God to grant him fame. When Mozart appears at the Hapsburg court, Salieri soon realises that the little man's skills greatly surpass his own. Salieri's desperate disbelief is deepened by Mozart's childishness, na�ve arrogance, and coarseness. How can genius and vulgarity undergo such an ill-chosen alliance? Thirty years after Mozart's death, a rumour is spread throughout the whole of Vienna: Salieri is said to have poisoned Mozart. The source: the Italian himself. And here we are, right at the beginning of the play. Feeling embittered by age and his past, Salieri addresses the audience to confess all sins he has ever committed. In an extended flashback, he takes us back to the most beautiful and most devastating moments of his life and career. Forgiveness is impossible, but is understanding? How did all this come to pass? And did Salieri really murder Mozart?

Peter Shaffer's Amadeus was first performed at the Royal National Theatre in London in 1979. It has been a theatrical hit ever since and is regularly staged all around the globe. The film adaptation won eight Oscars, including best picture, best director, and best actor.

Despite its historical inaccuracies, Richard III remains one of Shakespeare's most popular plays. The mixture of tragedy, political intrigue and comedy is irresistible. At its centre stands Richard, duke of Gloucester - perhaps the ultimate stage villain - a character who has fascinated audiences for over 400 years.

Our bold new production transposes the action from the fifteenth century to the much more familiar England of the late 1940s; a time of celebration and national pride, but also a time of shortages and mourning ... an ideal time for an opportunist tyrant to make his play for power. Richard is determined to become king - and the only things that stand between him and the crown are his own family and most of the English nobility ... no problem.

Special Event: 'Richard..... Really?' Immediately after the performance on Sunday 10th March. A panel discussion on just who Richard was: the historical figure, Tudor propaganda, and a certain car park! Hosted by Lilianna Komljenovic the panel will include Richard III Society Secretary Julia Redlich, Director Gary Dooley, and lead actor Roger Gimblett with members of the Company. Complimentary wine and nibbles will be served and the invitation is available only to audience members at the 10th March performance.

Join Shakespeare's notorious serial killer as he lies, cheats and murders his way to become king in this exciting new take on an all-time classic play.

Dear Daisy Meredith. Forced to endure middle class servitude from the wrong side of the tracks, she positively leaps, salmon-like, at the chance of attending Grangewood School for Young Ladies. Naturally, she has to overcome beastly snobs who don't want her type at their school, foul, beastly plots to besmirch her name and get her expelled, skullduggery (of a beastly nature), and even the shame of having to learn hockey from a beastly book!

But, in this affectionate, non-beastly look at innocent school days long gone, I have a sneaking suspicion that Daisy, Trixie and all their plucky chums might just save the day, save the school and find enough time for a wizard midnight feast or two! Oh, do say you'll join us? It promises to be ripping fun!

Delightful Christmas family fare - Lynne Lancaster, artsHub

The Star-Child is one of the delightful short fables Wilde wrote for his sons and in this brand new musical version is reimagined with toe-tapping numbers, a witty contemporary script and extraordinary special effects.

The Star-Child is the story of an infant boy found abandoned in the woods by a poor woodcutter, who pities him and takes him in.

He grows up to be exceedingly beautiful, but vain, cruel, and arrogant, believing himself to be a divine child who had fallen from the stars.

One day, a haggard beggar comes to town in search of her lost son, who the Star-Child is revealed to be. However, he rejects her and sends her away, and in doing so, is magically transformed to a loathsome looking creature as a punishment.

His followers abandon him, and he sets off to seek forgiveness from his mother.

His subsequent adventures include being sold as a slave to an evil magician, being rescued by a tap-dancing rabbit and, ultimately, discovering that true beauty lies in the quality of a mans heart.

Witty, touching and uplifting this fun-filled Family musical is the perfect pre-Christmas treat for all ages!! Tickets are available separately from subscription.

Hilary Moynihan has lived in Sorrento, a small Victorian seaside town, all her life. Her two sisters have been gone for years leaving Hilary to care for her aging father and 16 year old son. The three sisters are reunited when Pip returns from New York and Meg from England, with her English husband, after Meg's semi-autobiographical novel is short-listed for the Booker prize.

Hannie Rayson was inspired to write this play after Peter Carey won his first Booker Prize for Oscar and Lucinda. It is a very realistic portrayal of family relationships as well as addressing many issues and themes such as masculinity and Australian identity.

comedy with a bite and a filigree of sentiment - Paul Nolan, Sydney Arts Guide

George Brent and his wife Jennifer, a romantic novelist, separated when their two children were tiny. He made a new life among the 'horsey' set of rural England, she took the children to the Continent and brought them up in a bohemian atmosphere. Now, 17 or so years on, the children decide to return to England and meet their father.... and their stepmother.... and, needless to say, they have a plan....!!!

This was Coward's second performed play, premiering at the Savoy Theatre in 1923, and it marked his arrival at the age of 22 as the voice of a new generation. The play always remained one of his personal favourites and we are delighted to bring this rarely seen delight to our stage!

A superb courtroom thriller. When Leonard Vole is accused of murder he seeks the assistance of a famous barrister, Sir Wilfrid.

Unfortunately for Leonard all the evidence is against him: he was alone with the woman on the night of her murder, the main benefactor of her will, and the police had found blood on his shirt.

His only alibi is that he was with his wife at the time of the murder.

But, to his horror Sir Wilfrid discovers that Leonard's wife is going to give damning evidence against her husband...

At long last Bernard Shaw's masterpiece telling the extraordinary tale of Joan of Arc comes to the Genesian Stage in celebration of 600 years since the birth of Joan.
Saint Joan
 is the story of a country girl in her late teens who, inspired by God, declares her bloody mission to drive the English from France and to crown the reluctant Dauphin as King.
With staggering confidence, she takes command of the army and conducts a brutal campaign that leads to Charles VII's coronation. But she is soon regarded as a threat to both the fabric of feudal society and the Church across Europe. Within one year she is burnt at the stake.
Saint Joan
 was published not long after the canonization of Joan of Arc and dramatises what is known of her life based on the substantial records of her trial. Shaw studied the transcripts and in his preface to the play comments:
""There are no villains in the piece... It is what men do at their best, with good intentions, and what normal men and women find that they must and will do in spite of their intentions, that really concern us.""

Joan is the personification of the tragic heroine and the part is considered by actresses to be one of the most challenging of roles to interpret, often compared to the challenge of playing Hamlet. Notable St. Joans have included Jean Seberg, Sybil Thorndike, Joan Plowright, Lynn Redgrave, Judi Dench and Imogen Stubbs.
Although the play deals with dramatic and weighty subjects its brilliance is that it is also very funny and ultimately deeply moving.
The Genesian Theatre is delighted that Kevin Jackson has agreed to direct the production. Kevin is widely known for his inspiring work as one of Australia's most experienced acting teachers with years of experience at the National Institute of Dramatic Arts (NIDA) and the American Conservatory Theatre (ACT) in San Francisco. Kevin has long held an interest in the works of Shaw and we are absolutely delighted he has agreed to make his skills and knowledge available to us. We are also delighted to announce that rising young director Con Costi will be acting as Assistant to Kevin on this production.
Join the Genesians in celebrating the 600th birthday of one of history's greatest women. There will be cake, bubbly and croissants on the house! So put on your party dress (or suit) and let the festivities begin! Celebrations will start at 7 pm before the play at 8 pm.

This gripping and thought provoking play, shot through with dry humour, tackles the private and public agony of the British Royal family upon his decision to abdicate the throne when the government makes it quite plain that Wallis Simpson will never be acceptable as his queen.

In celebration of the 200th anniversary of the great man's birth the Genesians are proud to premiere this new adaptation of Charles Dickens' great novel.

Young orphan Pip lives with his sister and her husband blacksmith Joe Gargery in a humble village when his life is turned upside down by a meeting with an escaped convict and subsequently his introduction to eccentric recluse Miss Havisham and her adopted daughter Estella. As Pip is suddenly removed from his humble origins and transformed into a young gentleman of great expectations he gains much but ultimately realises he has lost himself on the journey.

Dickens' wonderful characters are brought to life by a talented cast of old and new Genesian faces, with detailed period costuming from Peter Henson, in this stunning new adaptation by Roger Gimblett 'Mr Theatre'.

Bored colonial Richard Hannay is thrust into the thrilling world of international espionage when the beautiful Annabella dies in his arms, a knife in her back. Suspected of her murder he flees from the police to the Scottish moors on the track of a vicious gang of spies.
The movie is a thriller, the play is a farce. At face perhaps an apparent contradiction, but of  course there is always a very fine line between the two. Crank up the tension of a thriller a notch and it immediately becomes a comedy.
That is largely what makes this play work - Hannay is a little bit more dashing, rugged and handsome, the women he meets are a little bit more beautiful and enticing, the villians even more evil and dastardly. Everything larger than life and theatrical, as after all befits a movie that is placed on stage.
With a very talented cast of four presenting several hundred characters backed up by a highly experienced production team, this fast moving farce is sure to prove hugely entertaining!

Matthew Francis' adaptation of Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey is a fast paced journey of the naive, novel reading heroine Catherine Morland. Catherine's journey takes us on an adventure between her fantasy world of the gothic novel Udolpho and the reality of her new societal life in Bath, where we meet characters of seemingly faithful friendships and of tragic beguiled influence.

But as these two worlds head toward an inevitable clash it is her hero Mr Tilney that awakens her to the wisdom of ""we mustn't allow what we read to effect how we behave"". Together with traditional Regency dancing, Venetian mask work and stage and lighting effects this play will be a delightful theatrical experience.",https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2011/2/images/poster.jpg,"['https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2011/2/images/1.jpg', 'https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2011/2/images/2.jpg']"

On a cold winter's night no one was stirring, not even a mouse. No one that is, but a murderer in the house.

The most famous 'whodunit' in the world finally comes to downtown Sydney. In a new worldwide release, the longest running play in the world, Agatha Christie's Mousetrap opens September 3rd at the Genesian Theatre, the established home of mystery and murder.

Trapped in a blizzard, phone lines down, roads blocked, the unlucky occupants of a suitably isolated guesthouse are unsure of their fate but sure of one thing, someone has murder on their mind.

What dark secrets do they share?

What has brought them together in this place?

Who will survive?

Someone will die.

An Ideal Husband is a clever blend of comedy and drama superbly crafted with Oscar Wilde's customary flair and sharp, satirical and timeless wit.

A successful politician's career, honour and marriage are threatened when he is confronted with blackmail over a past misdeed. Wilde quickly establishes an intriguing plot and with an array of colourful characters and sparkling dialogue the story flows at a brisk pace.

Wilde's observations on power, morals, human frailities, marriage, politics and honour are still fresh today. His polished writing and sparkling repartee have lost none of their appeal and guarantee an evening of satisfying and entertaining theatre.

Captain Scott's epic, and ultimately fatal, final adventure is the true stuff of legend. Following his own brand of muscular Christianity, Scott led his men towards what he believed to be his pre-ordained destiny - pre-eminence at the South Pole. Ted Tally's insightful play examines whether one of recent history's most epic failures was a result of bad luck, bad planning or, as some historians believe, the final act in Scott's doomed existence.

In the centenary of their death, the play looks at the character of the men who lived and died in the Antarctic wastes and shows the human face of a fateful journey.

On 17 January 1912 Captain Robert Scott and his team arrived at the South Pole. To mark the centenary of that achievement, on Tuesday 17 January 2012 the Genesian Theatre will be presenting a gala performance of Terra Nova, all tickets $40 including complimentary drinks, supper, and a guest speaker.

In Shakespeare's Venice wild carnivals are held, money is thrown around and lovers fiendishly disguise themselves. The city and its rollicking citizens are extravagant and verging on the grotesque. Caught in the middle of this whirlwind of scandal and festivity are Antonio and Shylock. They are floating through surreal circumstances, displaced, angry and bound by a wager of flesh. Shylock is brutally persecuted and made evil. Antonio is disenchanted and recklessly assists Bassanio, trying to find a place in the new world.

The Merchant and the Money Lender are at odds with each other and yet, are somehow united as both are losing their grip in a Venice that is sinking into economic, cultural and judicial madness.

A delirious comedy, a dark fable, this heartbreaking tale of loss, love and revenge will be unmissable.

But they won't take me unless I can talk more genteel. He said he could teach me. Well, here I am ready to pay him--not asking any favor--and he treats me as if I was dirt.'
If ever a play deserved the title 'classic', the first offering of our season is that play! Based on the classical Greek myth,
Pygmalion
 has delighted audiences for generations as it plays on the complex business of human relationships in a class-based Society. When Professor Henry Higgins comes across a poor and uneducated Cockney girl named Eliza Doolittle he makes a bet that he can take Eliza from the gutters of London and pass her off as a society lady, by simply teaching her the right dialect in which to speak. The one thing he overlooks is that his ""creation"" has a mind of her own.
Shaw's brilliant comedy is of course well known as the source of the hit musical
My Fair Lady
 but those who have seen the musical shouldn't assume they know the play. Recently revived to huge acclaim in London by Sir Peter Hall and on Broadway starring Claire Danes, Shaw's incisive wit drives this timeless, utterly charming comedy.
Directed by New Zealand based Director and set designer Owen Gimblett and with sumptuous costuming from Nicola Griggs we invite you to come back to London in 1912 and discover that learning how to speak 'proper' is just one step on the journey to becoming a 'fair lady'.

He is oppressed by his obligation to his family since the father walked out on them - a crippled sister (Laura) who has become an ascetic and a mother (Amanda) who is determined to marry her off while reliving her own memories of being a Southern Belle with many gentlemen callers.

Set on a beach in Noosa on a summer's afternoon, it is the story of Liz (a prickly character in her sixties, clearly used to a position of power) who is taking some time out from her hectic life, for reasons which become apparent. On the beach she meets a beautiful young male surfer (Chris) and in the course of one short afternoon's conversation the two manage to share some secrets and surprises.",https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2010/5/images/poster.jpg,['https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2010/5/images/1.jpg']

At last the Genesian Theatre is proud to present the longest running musical in history The Fantasticks. Still running in New York where it opened in 1960 this most beautiful musical has won numerous honours and featured some of the worlds most famous performers in its casts over the years including Jerry Orbach, Liza Minnelli, F Murray Abraham and Joel Grey. Loosely based on the play Les Romanesques by Rostand the deceptively simple plot concerns two neighboring fathers who put up a wall between their houses to ensure that their children fall in love, because they know children always do what their parents forbid. After the children do fall in love, they discover their fathers' plot and, disillusioned, they each go off and experience 'the world'. Ultimately, they return to each other and the love they had, having learned from the world and made an informed decision. Elements of the play are drawn from the story of Pyramus and Thisbe, Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream as well as Donizetti's L'Elisir d'Amore and Rostand's play.

OZ Baby-boomer Review

'This was a good night in the theatre. Gimblett's approach to Hamlet was to play it as a thriller with Michael Schell's dark score driving the action. Leon Richardson's take on Hamlet was to show a deeply introverted man who was challenged to his core by the act that he was compelled to undertake. Robert Drew's garrulous, imposing Polonius, and Danielle Cooper's distraught, shattered Ophelia stood out. The cast were helped by Lissa Knight's apt costumes and Owen Gimblett's compact set.'
Stage Whispers Review

The Bard is back! On Saturday, 9th May, Shakespeare's Hamlet opens at Sydney's Genesian Theatre to celebrate its 65th anniversary season. This production of Hamlet is based on Roger Gimblett's acclaimed 2005 staging at the Tom Mann Theatre which engaged and captivated audiences. Shakespeare's tale of the troubled Prince of Denmark comes to life with period costuming and a stunning set and technical design. Director Roger Gimblett brings extensive experience garnered in England, Australia and his native New Zealand directing a variety of work. Hamlet is Gimblett's fifth Shakespeare and follows his successful staging of The Tempest at the Genesian in 2007.

An impressive cast, led by Leon Richardson in the title role has been assembled. Richardson has thrown himself headlong into the emotional and physical demands of playing the Dane. As Sir Derek Jacobi observed ""It is a role of dizzying challenge to any actor's armoury of mental, vocal and psychological ingenuity as well as a severe test of his physical stamina.""

This memorable production will push the boundaries of the actors and challenge the expectations of the audience but adhere faithfully to Shakespeare's work. The text has been carefully edited to ensure a tight and fast-paced production that will keep patrons on the edge of their seats throughout.

Teachers please note a 'Schools Pack' containing notes on the production and play will be available and question and answer sessions with the cast may be held by arrangement.

This is an outstanding opportunity for school students, lovers of Shakespeare and the first-time Shakespeare audience-member.",https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2009/1/images/poster.jpg,"['https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2009/1/images/1.jpg', 'https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2009/1/images/2.jpg']"

 a famous writer of mystery novels who lives alone in a remote cottage is discovered doing away with her no-good husband. Now she has a new nemesis. A twisted plot unfolds and takes many turns on its exciting journey towards a surprising end. We know you love our murder mysteries!
Come with us to 1950, to a cottage on the Yorkshire Moors, where Janet Preston is completing her latest novel. She is also busy making herself the heroine in her real life fantasy. However, the next few days turn out nothing like she planned. First there's the unexpected return of her estranged husband which complicates her desire to win the heart of a younger man. Then there's George, her husband's business associate to deal with and the nosey neighbourhood veterinarian Mr. Henderson keeps appearing. Janet is forced to make some deadly decisions.
Intent to Murder
 is reminiscent of many of Agatha Christie's finest thrillers, as it twists and turns through an intriguing, fast-paced plot. The audience is continually confronted by situations and characters which are neither black nor white, and Sands throws in some red herrings too. There is a surprising end to this gripping thriller.

Federico Garcia Lorca was a victim of the madness that swept Spain after the civil war. Murdered by one of Franco's death squads, his death at just 38 years of age is one of the great tragedies of that terrible war. The Genesian Theatre is excited to present his famous tragedy,
The House of Bernarda Alba
.
During a hot, Spanish summer a house is in mourning. Totally dominated by their mother, five lonely sisters waste their lives away in games of petty jealousies and bitterness. For Lorca, the mother represents the rise of fascism and repression in Spain in the period leading up to the war. It is easy to imagine the daughters as symbols of those in society fighting against this repression, only in some cases to end up as its tragic victims.
With original flamenco music, this fresh, new translation will update this classic tale. And, by another coincidence, the film,
Little Ashes

The Genesian Theatre is proud to bring you the multi-award winning play Journey's End by R.C. Sherriff. Set in the trenches of France during WWI, it examines the relationships of a group of British officers in a dugout in France.

The story weaves around the experiences and interactions of three officers Stanhope, Osborne and Raleigh; over a six day period of duty. The Commanding Officer of B Company is young Captain Stanhope, who has been fighting at the front line for three years and outlived most of his companions. With a strong sense of duty and responsibility, he is determined to see the war through and bravely lead his men regardless of the outcome. Heroic, strong and impassioned, Stanhope received the Military Cross; yet he has to face his internal demons.

More than just a poignant play about the loss of innocence, Journey's End appreciates the inner strengths of duty, honour, compassion and love felt by the soldiers; even when under the most difficult of situations. Moreover, Sherriff has also crafted a play which shows how people use the power of humour in a crisis to keep their sanity.

Enchanted April,"by Matthew Barber from a novel by Elizabeth von Arnim 
 Directed by Debbie Smith",2008-05-10,2008-06-28,{},{},{},"Set in England and Italy in the early 1920's, Enchanted April tells the story of Lotty Wilton, an edgy and nervous middle-aged woman who feels lost and detached from both her marriage and life in general. She persuades an acquaintance Rose Arnott to accompany her to Italy for the month of April to rent a charming villa and enjoy the 'wisteria and sunshine'. As the rent is more than they can afford, they advertise for two companions and get more they they were anticipating. One is the beautiful socialite Caroline Bramble, who is eager to get away from admiring eyes. The second traveller is a crotchety older woman Mrs Graves, who lives in the past with her dead husband and the famous literary scholars that she knew as a child.

This play is about how the women 'find' themselves and reconnect with the world around them through their developing friendships at the magical villa of ""San Salvatore"". This play is a touching examination of human frailty and strength. However, there are also many moments of comedy due to these four very different people being forced to live together under the care of the down-to-earth Italian housekeeper Costanza, who doesn't speak a word of English.

Enchanted April is an uplifting, whimsical play that audiences will enjoy. Its positive message of hope and happiness gives us all reassurance that better times are on the way.

Everyone deserves a bit of magic in their lives!

"To Celebrate World Youth Day 2008, the Genesian Theatre Presents Two One Act Plays","The Director: A Play About St Genesius 
 By Rebekah Jennings 
 Medieval Mystery Cycles 
 Traditional

: WYD08 Registered Pilgrims FREE on Friday, 18 July 2008 at 8pm.
This year the Genesian Theatre is proud to participate in World Youth Day 2008 by presenting two one act plays 'The Director' and a selection of the 'Medieval Mystery Cycles'.
The Director, a new piece from writer/director Rebekah Jennings, tells the story of Genesius, an actor who was martyred in 303A.D, half way through a performance, for converting to Christianity. The story is related by the director of the show who is thoroughly annoyed that he's lost his lead actor and like many of us, cannot understand the choice that Genesius has made.
The show is a two hander between the young, idealistic director who hopes to make his name and fortune in Rome and his older self who has never 'made it', and blames Genesius for his failure.
The Director deals with questions of faith, the reason behind suffering and the frustrations of theatre.
For something completely different the second performance of the evening is a selection of Medieval Mystery Cycles.  In the Middle Ages stories from the Bible were acted out in the churches as a way of making them more memorable for a largely illiterate population. As both the popularity and the bawdiness of the plays grew, they were moved to outside performance venues and following a Papal ban forbidding clergy to act in public, were taken over by the town's guilds.
These plays represent some of the earliest examples of 'community theatre' in the world. Each section was generally performed by the most 'appropriate' guild. For example, the Goldsmith's Guild would take charge of presenting the story of the Three Kings - no doubt because they could most easily locate the required props!
We will be performing the following cycles: The Creation and the Fall of Man, The Annunciation, The Shepherds, Herod & the King and The Slaughter of the Innocents.

Ring Round the Moon,"By Jean Anouilh adapted by Christopher Fry 
 Directed by Joyce Birch",2009-03-07,2009-04-25,{},{},{},"Welcome to the Genesian Theatre's production of Christopher Fry's most recent adaptation of Jean Anouilh's play
L'Invitation au Chateau
 entitled
Ring Round the Moon
.
The first English production was presented at the Globe Theatre, London, in 1950 and featured several luminaries of the English stage of that time including Paul Scofield, Claire Bloom and Margaret Rutherford. The play was directed by Peter Brook and designed by Oliver Messel.
The play has been critiqued as a ""souffl�  with razor blades"" and this is certainly an apt description - on the surface, it is a fast moving witty fairy story, but beneath there are deeper undertones of the social issues and conflicts.
We have set the play in Edwardian time, just prior to World War I. It is interesting that the scene I have chosen to end Act I was not in the original adaptation, but has been reinstated in this version of the script. I feel it adds to the complexity of the story.
With a beautiful set and costumes by Peter Henson, an enthusiastic production team and a great cast, we hope you'll enjoy a fine evening of entertainment with something to think about as well.

Shadowlands
 is a beautiful,moving play about the British author C.S. Lewis and hisrelationship with American poet Joy Davidman. Ittraces their friendship as it develops: first aswritten correspondence, through the first awkwardmeeting for afternoon tea, to a marriage ofconvenience which finally grows into a deep,passionate love affair. Balanced with the romanticscenes, this play has witty repartee between Lewis'friends who are Oxford dons and shows the comical, yetsincere relationship between Lewis and his brotherWarnie.
The play isn't just about taking the courageous stepto admit more than friendship and daring to fall inlove; it's about the things we value in life. Lewislearns that making connections, family, commitment andlove are what's important to add true meaning to hislife. In addition, as in real life, the main characterLewis is a very spiritual man with a strong Christianfaith. His beliefs are rocked to their foundation whenhe questions God's love of humanity as it causes somuch pain. The play is his journey of how he acceptslife and love and pays the consequences of it throughloss and grief.
This play offers a great night's entertainment but audiences will leave with so much more: The play examines the  issue of the strength of spirituality to sustain people through grief and suffering and the role of religious beliefs in modern times. In addition, the characters develop the idea of the importance of friendship, love and the making of connections with others. It's hard to box this play into a particular genre. It's a love story full of loss, a comedy filled with sadness and the true story of C.S. Lewis mixed with elements of fantasy. It's a play that will touch everyone's hearts.

""At last a deed worth doing!""

Henrik Ibsen was a playwright who revolutionized nineteenth century theatre. His settings and characters are firmly rooted in reality and deal frankly with such personal and social problems as the limited choices available to women to develop their potential.

Hedda Gabler is a woman whose mind is cramped by the provincial society in which she is trapped. Reared to take her place as a society hostess but without the means to support such a lifestyle after her father's death, she marries a scholarly middle class man whom she believes she can bring to prominence and so vicariously live a successful life through him. Her hopes are disappointed. She is trapped in a loveless marriage and must live out her life according to a set of standards totally alien to her upbringing.

This is a powerful play and deserves its reputation as a classic of modern theatre. Be prepared for an evening of compelling drama that you will want to think about and discuss well after the curtain falls.

After the loss of her husband and older son in a long and bitter feud with the Felix family, it is too much when her new daughter-in-law has confused feelings for one of its members. Only tragedy can result.
Although usually known as ""Blood Wedding"", the literal translation is deliberately used to evoke the history of doomed marriages amongst the various families. The production makes extensive use of the beautiful flamenco music of southern Spain, some of which was collated by Lorca himself. Unusually, the play is performed as a dramatic production and not the song and dance spectacular that is often associated with this work. The play enjoyed considerable success in London in 2006 with the exciting Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal in a lead role.
Set during a hot, dry summer in no particular era, the white stage with flashes of primary colour and Moorish tile work amidst the black figures brings the Andalucian setting to life. Of course it is a tragedy but its themes of desire for happiness and ultimate reconciliation are universal.
The large cast is a mix of seasoned performers and recent theatre school graduates.

Stoppard, The Real Inspector Hound, 1968.

Two theatre critics called Moon and Birdboot are attending the first night performance of a ridiculous murder mystery in the style of an Agatha Christie 'whodunit', set in the isolated country manor of Lord and Lady Muldoon where murder and mayhem ensue.

Inadvertently, Moon and Birdboot become involved in the action causing a series of events that parallel the play they are watching.

Stoppard's theatre is first and foremost, a stage, on which his plays aim primarily to entertain us. In Hound as it is affectionately known in theatre circles, Stoppard's surreal and absurdist view of the world is brilliantly portrayed by ludicrous stereotypes in purely farcical terms.

Introducing a wealth of new talent to the Genesian Theatre stage, including Nick Baker, Joseph Mifsud, Tim Hanna, Fran Bowick, Rachel Coleman, Jane Thorpe, Michael Sterbal and Greg Walsh, in which the verbal and visual wit of Stoppard combine to ensure a sparkling evening of entertainment, making this play ""a must"" for 2008.

Please note, that a twenty minute short thriller titled Lost Souls, written by Gordon Smith, directed by Barry Nielsen precedes this play, followed by a twenty minute interval. At 3 am in a deserted cemetery , a security guard is surprised by a beautiful woman... Featuring Naomi Englebrett and Paul Treacy, Lost Souls asks do you believe in ghosts? Do you believe in love?

Antony and Cleopatra,"by William Shakespeare 
 Directed by Joyce Birch",2008-03-08,2008-04-26,{},{},{},"Antony and Cleopatra is a famous love story of Roman times.
However, Shakespeare's text of the play also brings to life the great rivalry between Mark Antony and Octavius Caesar. These two men were vying for control of the Roman senate after the death of Julius Caesar - Octavius being the nephew of Julius and Antony, a highly popular Roman general.
We see Octavius' star rising as Antony's fades through this obsessive love for the capricious temptress Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, who draws Antony away from his Roman responsibilities.
Caesar and Antony with Cleopatra between them constitute the power struggle, which is the central theme of the play.
Some careful, judicious editing presents the audience with a good tight story and much of Shakespeare's beautiful language to enjoy.

Along with three unsuspecting bachelors, a jealous girlfriend, a somewhat eccentric nurse, mixed with some wonderful Cornish characters, this English comedy about life and love is pure entertainment.

A must see for all who adore English wit and humour.

Lady Windermere's Fan,"by Oscar Wilde 
 Directed by Anthony Stirling-Edgar",2007-01-06,2007-02-17,{},{},{}," Oscar Wilde described his first play, 'Lady Windermere's Fan', as ""one of those modern drawing-room plays with pink lampshades"". This typical example of Wildean wit serves as an entree to this delightful satire of the morals of British society under Victoria.

Lady Windermere suspects her husband of an infidelity. She confronts him, but he insists on inviting his apparent paramour to his wife's birthday celebrations! Lady Windermere flees to take refuge with her friend Lord Darlington, and it is there that her husband discovers her discarded fan...

This was Oscar Wilde's first play, and its great success encouraged him to continue writing for the stage to become one of the most highly regarded playwrights of the Victorian era.

The Genesian Theatre's production is set in 1892 with traditional costuming and a talented cast of new and old faces to the Genesian stage.

Shakespeare's tale of Prospero's Island is inherently theatrical, unfolding in a series of spectacles that involve exotic, supra-human, and sometimes invisible characters that the audience can see but other characters cannot. The play was composed by Shakespeare as a multi-sensory theater experience, with sound, and especially music and song, used to complement the 'other-worldliness' of the setting. Perhaps the most striking quality of The Tempest is the virtually unrivaled beauty of the language, every scene without exception overflowing with exotic images, magical descriptions, and a palpable lushness, witnessing the playwright at the height of his lyric powers.

Director Roger Gimblett returns to the Genesian Theatre with the same production team that worked on his acclaimed staging of Hamlet at the Tom Mann Theatre in 2005, promising a Tempest that is as accessible and entertaining as it is spectacular. Michael O'Connell, last seen on the Genesian stage in Wilde's An Ideal Husband, tackles the demanding role of Prospero and leads a large and talented cast of new and old faces.

Filled with magic and mystery, revenge and eventual reconciliation, comedy and sorrow, and most importantly, forgiveness and love, don't miss this chance to see a play that has delighted and inspired people around the world for 400 years.

This production of The Hound promises to engage and captivate audiences as Conan Doyle's classic tale of a seemingly cursed aristocratic family comes to life in the splendour of the Victorian era.  Director, Loretta Tolnai, says ""this new production brings back Conan Dolye's much loved and familiar characters in a great old fashioned murder mystery with a few surprises"".
Tolnai brings a creative flair to the production having directed a variety of work from other popular stage productions including The Forsyte Sage and Two Weeks with the Queen as well as Pinter's famous psychological thriller of two unlikely gangsters, The Dumb Waiter.
Tolnai has assembled an impressive cast, led by English actor Keith McIlroy as the famous sleuth, Sherlock Holmes.  McIlroy has appeared in many lead roles on the Sydney theatre circuit including 'Glagolyev' in Michael Frayn's Chekhov  adaptation, Wild Honey at NIDA Studio; 'Jack Barker' in Dennis Potter's  Sufficient Carbohydrate at Strathfield Theatre; 'Uncle Bob' in Mary  Morris's Two Weeks with the Queen at Genesian Theatre; 'Harry Kane' in Pinter's  The Collection at Pact theatre, to name only a few.
Holmes's trusty confidant, Doctor Watson, is played by Richard Sherwood. Richard has captured the childlike essence of Watson's inquisitive character and brings a wealth of experience to the role.  Richard has appeared in  Michael Gow's Away and most recently in Tolnai's stage adaptation of The Forsyte Saga.
Tim Kelly's adaptation of this classic book ensures a tight and fast-pacedproduction that will keep patrons on the edge of their seats throughout.

In every discussion ""The Lion in Winter"", stands as, if not her best, then certainly one of her best. She won theAcademy Award as did the playwright James Goldman for the screenplay adaptationfrom his theatre classic.
It is Christmas 1183 and the first Plantagenet Henry II and his wife Eleanorof Aquitaine celebrate, with their three sons, Richard, Geoffrey and John at ChinonCastle. This is the original dysfunctional family struggling to find who will inheritthe English throne on Henry's death. Their struggle encompasses brilliant dialogueand a wit and intelligence which jumps from the page. The characters weave their waythrough plot and counter-plot, murder and betrayal. Many people are surprised tolearn that Goldman created his play as a comedy; such is its dramatic impact. It explores the best and worst of human nature with language that is inspired andcharacters that are fascinating.
The cast includes Dave Went, Pamela Rome, Anthony Stirling-Edgar. Katie Gompertz,Sean Skuthorp, Daniel Jackson and Patrick Magee
Director Paula Bate has previously staged An Ideal Husband, Round and Round theGarden, The Business of Murder, Enter a Free Man, Dial M for Murder, Harvey, BillyBudd and Arsenic and Old Lace for the Company.
""Lion in Winter"" will open at the Genesian Theatre 420 Kent Street on Saturday18 September and run Fridays, Saturdays at 8pm and Sundays at 4.30pm until Saturday 30 October.

Opening at Sydney's Genesian Theatre on January 8, 2005, this new andexciting production of The Forsyte Saga will excite audiences at Sydney'soldest little theatre.  The Genesian, celebrating its 60th anniversary,is well-known for staging fully-costumed, period epics.  This production,based on John Galsworthy's three Forsyte novels, spans three generationsfrom 1886 through to the roaring twenties.
Loretta Tolnai, director, believes that this season will have broadappeal, based on the popularity of the recent Granada television serieswhich was recently aired on the ABC: ""This is one of the truly greatstories of English literature, set at a time when the world was rapidlychanging at the beginning of the twentieth century. The production isbound to get audiences talking about society's expectations of women inthe Victorian era and their changing status.""  She added ""our experienced cast has brought to life the story's memorable characters, and audienceswill be totally enthralled as the play reaches its moving and surprising conclusion.""
The Forsyte Saga does more than expose the flaws at the core of politeEnglish society - it is a timeless story of the conflict between the desireto possess and the need to be loved.

The ""Egads, Zounds and Pshaws"" of the 1780's characters were reflected in thelanguage of the ""Kissy, Kissy, Hug, Hug, Greed is Good, Absolutely Fabulous,Legends in their own Lunchtime"" 1980's Socialites.  Whilst the setting of thisproduction has moved forward to the 20th century, the language and manners of aplay written two centuries earlier have remained"" Karen says.
Sheridan biographers agree there was no authorised version of the play publishedin his lifetime.  Current texts may usually be traced to the two volume Murryedition of Sheridan's plays published in 1821.  Some of the changes from the originalmanuscript, such as the blending of Miss Verjuice and Snake, were made for dramatic,or economic, reasons.  ""We have retained the blended character"" says Karen, ""but,Snake is now Ms Snake.""
A formidable team of Artistic, Production and Acting talent, including some ofyour favourite Genesians as well as new faces to our stage, have combined to bringtogether Mr Sheridan's wit and the big shoulder pads of the 1980's, in this sparklingproduction of The School for Scandal.

Despite top credentials testifying to her teaching ability,in the early 1940's, Cusack was banished to the bush, by the Departmentof Education,  where she was made supernumerary, given no examination responsibilities,told to fill in for other teachers when they were ill and make the morning tea.
Morning Sacrifice, set over three days in the staff room of Easthaven Girls' School,is said to be Cusack's revenge on the Department as it exposes the hidebound educationsystem of the 1930's.  Nine teachers, a mix of conservatives and progressives, playoffice games and struggle for favouritism, while an unnoticed tragedy unfolds around them.
First performed in 1942, Morning Sacrifice has since become a classic of Australian theatre.

The Harp in the South,"by Ruth Park 
 Adapted by Ruth Park and Leslie Rees 
 Directed by Pamela Whalan and Rebekah Jennings",2003-11-08,2003-12-20,{},{},{},"Come and meet the Darcy family. There is Mumma, who has maintained an innocenceand purity of heart despite living in the mean and dirty streets of the slums; herhusband Hughie, a hard working, hard drinking family man; Rowena, the gentle daughter and Dolour the irrepressible one. Then, of course, there is Grandma, the loveable scamp whose enthusiasm for life is undiminished even though her body may be wearing out.
They live at 12� Plymouth Street Surry Hills in the late 1940s. There is little money but lots of love and laughter, tears and sorrow in this crowded household.
It has been said that Ireland's greatest export is her people. Grandma migrated from Ireland as a young girl. Hughie is the son of Irish immigrants. The Harp of Ireland plays a different tune in this southern land half a world away but the quality of the instrument remains true as the Irishness of this family adapts to the  conditions of Surry Hills.
The Harp in the South won a writing competition held by the Sydney Morning Herald in 1947 and the Darcy family has remained a firm favourite with every generation of Australians since its first publication. Ruth Park collaborated with Leslie Rees to adapt her novel for the stage. The play was first produced at the Independent Theatre, North Sydney in March 1949. It was directed by Doris Fitton. More recently The Harp in the South was made into a successful mini-series for television.
We know that you will enjoy the company of the Darcy family when you meet them during this evening of bittersweet entertainment at the Genesian Theatre, 420 Kent Street, Sydney.

This is oneof Wilde's most important plays and presents Wilde at his most joyous and idealistic in the setting of a dark family situation.  He presents to us his vision of the future, the central role of love and the truly honourable life in this vision. This is in contrast to the superficial party scene of the contextual characters.
The play contains Wilde's most beautiful writing.  The speeches given to the two heroines, Rachelle Arbuthnot and Hester Worsley, are startlingin their relevance even today in a world which seems overwhelmed with tiredand even cynical values.  The deep and moving meaning of the lives of thecentral characters are set against glittering London Society at the turn ofthe 19th Century and Wilde's language of this society is at its most wittyincluding the scandalous description of the fox hunters, ""The unspeakable inpursuit of the uneatable"" and aphorisms like, ""Nothing succeeds like excess.""

Widely regarded as William Shakespeare's greatest play, it combines tragedywith some of the most beautiful poetry in the English language. TheGenesians last tackled the piece in 1967 with a cast that included PeterCarroll.
Director Gary Dooley is no stranger to Shakespeare having directedproductions in Australia, the United States and England, but this is hisfirst encounter with King Lear. With its storms, battles and violence, thisplay would stretch the resources of any theatre company however Dooley isundeterred ""We've been faithful to the play but I think we still have a fewsurprises up our sleeve' he says.
This new production of King Lear takes a bold approach, featuring a finecast of 17 actors and a stunning design using theatrical influences fromEdwardian to modern Japanese. The set promises a huge pond with fountains -something we've never seen before on our Genesian stage.
King Lear decides to divide up his kingdom between his three daughters basedon which one professes to love him the most. This rash decision is thecatalyst for a bloody chain of events culminating in civil war and personaltragedy.
What does it mean to love another human being?
What does it mean to be human at all?
This is a play that dares to ask the big questions, but also remains anintensely personal experience.
Demand for this season is anticipated to be high and early booking isrecommended.",https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2002/6/images/poster.jpg,"['https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2002/6/images/LEAR1.jpg', 'https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2002/6/images/LEAR2.jpg', 'https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2002/6/images/LEAR3.jpg']"

Not a particularly memorable remark, except Sheila isnot introducing herself to Bridie in a drawing room, rather they are in the middle of the SouthChina Sea!
For the next three and one-half years, Army nurses, civilian women and children werePrisoners of War in various camps in Java and Sumatra; camps where no rules seemed toapply and where they faced demanding and appalling challenges.Fifty years after their release, Bridie and Sheila are re-united and relate how they met thesechallenges.   Although Bridie and Sheila are characters, every event in the play occurredbetween 1942 and 1995. Such is the fabric of ""The Shoe-Horn Sonata"".
Written in 1995 for ""Australia Remembers,`, the 50th Anniversary of Peace, the GenesianTheatre is proud to present The Shoe-Horn Sonata by John Misto, who wrote, ""I do not havethe power to build a memorial, so I wrote a play instead."" A more fitting memorial to thesewonderful women could never be sculpted in stone; no piece of marble could relate this storyof love, courage and survival with such humour and heart.

He takes with him Lucie, Manette's daughter, who has never known her father. In Paris Dr Manette is being cared for by his old servant, wine-shop owner Ernest Defarge and his wife, Therese. The action then shifts to the Old Bailey, London, where 5 years later Charles Darnay is on trial as a suspected spy. Lorry, Dr Manette and Lucie are called as witnesses as they meet Darnay on the boat returning from France. Darnay is saved by his strange likeness to a lawyer called Sydney Carton, who works for Defence Counsel Mr Stryver. Soon Darnay, Stryver and Carton are all rivals for the affection of Lucie Manette. However she falls in love with, and marries, Darnaym although Carton, a dissolute cynic, has sworn his love and loyalty to her. Meanwhile the situation in France deteriorates, the peasants storm the Bastille, and overthrow the government. Darnay (who is actually the nephew and heir of a recently assasinated French aristocrat, the Marquis St. Evermonde) is summoned to Paris to save an old servant, Gabelle, who has been arrested by the new revolutionary government. Reluctantly and not fully realizing the danger, he sets out for France.
Act Two begins with Lucie and Dr Manette arriving in Paris and seeking out Mr Lorry who is working for the bank there. They have heard that Darnay has been arrested as an 'Emigre Aristocrat'. The next day, in the Revolutionary Tribunal, Dr Manette's status as a heroic Bastille prisoner saves his son-in-law from the guillotine. All seems well, until Darnay is almost immediately rearrested having been denounced with new information from an unknown source. Meanwhile Sydney Carton has arrived in Paris to do what he can to help Lucie and Darnay. He makes his own plans as Darnay appears again in the Revolutionary Tribunal where an ancient story is revealed which condemns Darnay to death.

While waiting to pay at the counter Hatcher looked down at a rack of tabloids and saw a headline on the cover of The Weekly World News, which read 'Titanic Survivor Found on Iceberg'. The paper told the story of a woman who had been found floating on an iceberg in the North Atlantic.

The calm, respectable world of Mansfield Park where Sir Thomas and Lady Bextram reside withtheir four children and Fanny, eldest daughter of the impoverished Mrs Price, is disrupted by thearrival in the district of the charming but worldly Crawfords. Henry Crawford flirts outrageouslywith the young women but are his intentions honourable? His sister Mary, beautiful andsophisticated, is attracted to the second son of the family as much as he is attracted to her, but canshe resign herself to be the wife of a country parson when she so much enjoys the pleasures ofLondon society? The rash conduct of the young people is observed acutely by poor relationFanny who is powerless to help, while those who should be guiding and advising are eitherabsent, fussing over trifles, or dozing peacefully by the fire.
The novel has been adapted for the stage by Austen scholar Pamola Whalan, who is also directingthis production. She works once more with set and costume designer Peter Henson. You mayremember the beautiful set and costumes he provided for Pamela's 2000 production of Emma.This production will be another visual treat.Mansfield Park: a play has its preview on Friday 4 January at 8.00pm, and opens Saturday 5January at 8.00pm.

Leaving school at 15 armed with one ""O"" level, Russell had a vague idea of being a writer, but drifted into hairdressing and labouring before returning, in his 20's, to full time education.

This background, coupled with Russell's strong view on the working classes' attempt to gain access to middle class culture, are reflected in Educating Rita. Originally commissioned by the RSC, Educating Rita was successfully produced in the West End, winning the award for Best Comedy of 1980. Still freely available on video, Educating Rita was adapted by Russell for the Oscar nominated 1983 film starring Michael Caine and Julie Waters.

The Genesian Theatre production of Educating Rita marks the directing debut of Karen O'Brien-Hall, and brings together the talents of Gregory Balcombe, who last appeared at the Genesian Theatre in ""The Woman in Black""; and Monica Brian the delightful Viola in our production of ""Twelfth Night"".

""Ladies Who Lunch""
 something struck me immediately. How easy it seems to make millions of dollars on the money markets. I need a career change!!!
Then I started thinking that vast amounts of money are traded daily, billions are gained (and lost) every second. Ah, then why if it's possible to accumulate such wealth so quickly is poverty so prevalent?? It's a childish notion, I know, but the loose change we as individuals donate to charity seems insignificant in comparison to the amounts discussed in the play. It's a simple question but a hard one to answer. The world's wealth is in the hands of a small few. Perhaps Amelia is right, we do need a few more modern day Robin Hoods!!
The play itself does not attempt to solve the problem, but what it does make us see, through the characters and their relationships is the age-old adage that money cannot buy happiness. This is the focus of the play's action and you are invited to observe each character's obsession, as each has to address the reality of their lives.
For the play may seem to be about money..... but underneath what it is really about is people.",https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2000/4/images/poster.jpg,"['https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2000/4/images/LADIES1.jpg', 'https://www.genesiantheatre.com.au/s2000/4/images/LADIES2.jpg']"

Inspector Bruton (Barry Nielson) investigates but finds that even his own officers (Robert Matek, Meg Carrol, Ray Forsyth) seem to know rather too much about this ultimate celebrity couple. A witty modern thriller with an unexpected twist this play breathes new life into the murder mystery genre.

The curtain raiser for the evening, The Monkey's Paw, was published in 1902 and is the first of the supernatural thrillers. The Monkey's Paw allows the audience to create its own horror, a far more terrifying manifestation than ever the make-up artist is able to devise.

The sixties marked a point of revolution in modern music, which reflected societal changes as a whole and a newfound freedom of expression. This era makes the perfect for Twelfth Night for of all Shakespeare's plays , it is the most highly focussed on free expression and the music of love. The sixties was an era of new freedoms and ambiguities, endless possibilities and blurred boundaries and thus provides a perfect setting for Twelfth Night's fantasy of desire, undifferentiated and uncontrolled by the constraints of normality, etiquette or even gender.

The play shows, and the period echoes, the fragile boundaries between friendship and lvoe, and the universality of desire, which cannot by continued or limited. Thus, this bittersweet comedy is very poignant for the issues of contemporary Sydney society.

Performed in the inner city theatre where Australia's most famous Shakespearian actor and director, John Bell, once trod the boards, the Genesian Theatre is the perfect setting for this unique Shakespearian production.

They are accompanied by such diversions as his widowed mother's own bashful courtship; a mistaken identity, with its own disastrous repercussions; a pathetic Victorian recitation; poison in the wrong teacup; and the parlourmaid's taste in naughty novels.

Born in 1939, he worked in theatre from the time he left school, writing the trilogy in 1973 for the Tiny Library Theatre-in-the-Round in Scarborough, where he first staged all his plays. Ayckbourn tells us that he ignored London sources who informed him that writing trilogies was not 'a good thing'. He had found that with a new play it was safer to never look further than Scarborough and to achieve success there. Scarborough is a holiday town with an ever changing population, and if it was essential to see all three plays to appreciate the trilogy, or any one of them, this would probably result in no audience at all, ""The Norman Conquest"" plays are therefore able to stand independently and may be seen in any order. As the Library Theatre could only afford six actors then the trilogy has a cast of six.

Ayckbourn decided to write ""The Norman Conquests"" crosswise. He started with Scene One of ""Round and Round the Garden"", then the Scene Ones of the other two plays and on through the Scene Twos. Comic climaxes seemed to abound everywhere and each play began to develop an atmosphere of its own. The West End production opened at the Globe Theatre London in August 1974 and the cast include Tim Courtenay, Michael Gambon, Penelope Keith and Felicity Kendal

I Have Five Daughters
, made from Austen's novel
Pride & Prejudice
, looks at the dilemma of having five daughters and little money, in an age when the only respectable career for a gently born girl was marriage. Mr. Bennet seems to look on the predicament as comic, but Mrs. Bennet strives with all her might to find husbands, suitable or not, for beautiful Jane, witty Elizabeth, dull Mary, fretful Kitty and bold Lydia. Her manoeuvres provide us with a charming view of an elegant bygone age inhabited by characters very much like people we know today.

Surprisingly, Harris is a noted writer of thrillers for stage and television. He considers The Business of Murder to be his best. Set in England in the nineteen-eighties, it is a tale of revenge, but no ordinary revenge.

You are a policeman, and a distraught father summons you to a meeting with his son who has become involved in the drug trade and now wishes to inform. Except there is no son.

You are a television writer, and you receive a letter from a woman accompanying a play she has written for television. It is not very good, however, her husband 'phones and begs you see his wife and give her some encouragment. She is terminally ill with only a few months to live. You agree. You go to their flat. Except there is no wife.

Suddenly you are plunged into a nightmare - the business of murder.

Who is this man? What is his motive? How will it end?

Harris' play is a real thriller, the best to be written in years, with more twists than a corkscrew. A step back to the classic days of Hitchcock. Tense, taut, terrific.

The Hostess is furious at the behaviour of one, Sly by name, who is just drunk enough not to care and falls into blissful oblivion. Wakened by a fair maiden(???) Sly is not quite prepared for what is to come.
The Taming of the Shrew
 has been described as a problem play. Two problems in particular have concerned modern directors; the often discarded ""Sly"" scenes at the beginning of the play and the unrelenting, physical battle of the sexes which usually makes half the audience of a modern revival squirm. This production does include the ""Sly"" scenes and closes with an epilogue borrowed from an earlier dramatic version of the ""Shrew"" story. The main play becomes Sly's dream.
Setting the play in the twenties draws attention to the emergence of women from their stifled and controlled existence with, to use Kate's words,
""the spirit to resist!""
 The twenties was a period of change and recognition - a discarding of traditional beliefs and values and an embracing of life to the fullest!

Kaufman and Hart's classic comedy
The Man Who Came to Dinner.
 offers a laugh a minute as so many rabbits are pulled from so many hats that theatregoers will applaud the wit, skill and panache of this talented duo.
John Mason Brown writing on Kaufman observed ""I'd rather see a play I can laugh at tonight than one which I might possibly read fifty years from now"".
The Man Who Came to Dinner
 satisfies on both counts; it is hilarious and apparently timeless.
How the Stanley's cope with Sheridan, his secretary, nurse, sycophantic friends and special Christmas broadcast will leave you laughing long after curtain call.

 is a play of stature. It's about many things: growing up and failing to grow up; dreams and illusions shaken by realities and the passing of time; responsibility and irresponsibility; sowing and reaping, etc; but what interested me most was Lawler's encapsulation of a new mythology, an Anglo-Celtic Australian mythology or dream-time. Roo Webber and Barney Ibbott come into the Leech household as heroes. These cane cutters from Queensland who fly south to Melbourne for the lay-off season are larger than life, yes, almost mythical figures. Olive Leech their barmaid friend, compares them to ""a coupla kings"" and ""eagles flying down from the sun"". The realist of the play, Pearl Cunningham, finds the comparison  ridiculous, but she too has her own dreams.
The characters of Lawler's play, like all human beings, need their dreams and mythology and romanticism, they need their own personal dream-times, just as Australians of Anglo-Celtic origins need a dream-time to return to. In his play, Ray Lawler provides an occasion for this in helping to clarify just what it is. We do need to go forward and progress and grow-up, but at times we also need to return.

Carmen the bartender sympathises without listening, Able the gormless sailor admires without understanding, Harry mocks him and Florence politely allows him to run on, not realising that Riley with his genius for one-sided conversations is convincing himself that she will give him the appreciation which he no longer receives from Persephone.
At home his wife does not take him seriously and Linda resents him because she is forced to dole out money to him which he meticulously records in the delusion that it will be repaid when his ""ship comes in"". Riley's self esteem is about to be punctured by Harry and Florence, but it is rubbery enough for such punctures to be easily repaired. He is ""unsinkable despite the slow leak"".
A delightful comedy with inspired language, Stoppard creates Riley as a lovable embarrassment but always thoroughly enjoyable.

I Hate Hamlet
 came to be here tonight. In reality another production I was to direct, could not be mounted. In hindsight - a great result!
Tim Bennett, my wife Pamela and I were looking for another Christmas show. After reading a number of scripts, we thought to look at our library of theatrical programmes and found one for the Marion Street production of
I Hate Hamlet
. We had all seen the show and thought that, with the right people and some clever design, it could be mounted on the Genesian stage and be a worthy Christmas production.
I had worked with designer Warren Barnard on two previous productions and was touring with him for Premier State Ballet when he came up with a design that made the whole project technically feasible.
I was also able to attract to the auditions a great selection of actors who gave their all and, finally, tonight you will see
I Hate Hamlet
 with one of the best non-professional casts available.

I have been overwhelmed by the generosity of everyone involved in this production. So much so, that I now feel indebted to them and also, in the process, I have made many new friends.
The art of communication is not something we can perform on our own; as much as we want to say something, the other person may not be capable of understanding; and as much as we want to listen, the other person may be talking another language. So we find ourselves playing charades. Oh what fun! and the conversations we have! We receive and send information...
If tonight, you promise to listen carefully, the performers will share a story with you: a simple theatrical feast. I know because this wonderful cast has told me the story many times during rehearsal, and I laughed a lot, but I also think they're trying to tell us something else ... could it be about communication?

One exeception is
'Dial M for Murder'
 by Frederick Knott, who also write
'Wait Until Dark'
. Knott supplies us with a simple but ingenious plot, which is foiled by the factor which has caught all of us from time to time; that someone doesn't act exactly as we expect them to, or do exactly as they have been told.
'Dial M for Murder'
 is a play about justice, it is not a play about nice people. None of the characters, with the exception of the Police Inspector, give us very much to admire. This apparently was one of the things which attracted Alfred Hitchcoock to direct his film version, but a film version still very much within the basic qualities of the play, which is its confinement within the prosecenium.

First produced in 1934, Miss Hellman reworked the play for her 1952 New York production. It is this reworked script which has been chosen by Director Joyce Birch for the current season; she has however set the play in Australia.

Teachers Martha and Karen run a school for girls in a converted farmhouse in country Victoria. The equilibrium of their lives is shattered when, taking a remark made by Martha's self-centred aunt, student Mary Tilford starts a malicious and unfounded rumour. The rumour turns to scandal and, understanding the power she wields, Mary sticks to her story, even implicating the hapless Rosalie. Although Mrs Tilford, Mary's grandmother, eventually discovers the truth, it is too late to prevent irreparable damage to many lives, including her own.

A strong, dramatic play, The Children's Hour is a touching story of real people, written with a psychological insight which awakens generosity of spirit in its audiences.

 was produced on Broadway by Bill Wilden. Originally produced by the Circle Repertory Company, New York City in 1987.
The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940
 is performed at the Kent St Theatre with the kind permission of Warner Chappell Plays Pty Ltd.
Tonight, the story starts when a highly successful Broadway production team are brought together at an isolated country mansion - apparently to prepare for a backer's audition for their new musical. However, there is another reason for the gathering... New York's best and brightest are making one last attempt to solve the identity of ""The Stage Door Slasher"", the murderer responsible for the tragic end of the team's last production! But is the slasher really a German spy or just another sour kraut? While a blizzard rages outside, the composer, lyricist, director and actors prepare for what could be their last performance... if only they could keep track of each other!!!!

, set during 1939-1945 in Newcastle, reveals in a comic nostalgia manner Taylor's feelings about World War II. He says, ""I grew up during the war under a deeply felt anxiety that the Germans might win the war, overrun Britain.""
In noting the size and scope of Taylor's work, one theatre critic observed, ""It would be surprising if future generations don't take an interest in his work. For one thing, it will help them understand the 20th century.""

He says that although there are parallels that can be drawn, it is more the story of what was the British theatre from the early 18th Century until the late 1930s, and I agree with him.

Further, I feel the play closely parallels William Shakespear's King Lear. In The Dresser, the 3 female roles can be closely compared with Lear's 3 daughters. None, save perhaps Irene (who anyway has her own purpose to pursue), shows compassion to the ailing Sir. All push, drive and contrive to get something from him. All this contributes to his worsening state, as is the case with King Lear. To me, Norman is the Fool of King Lear, Mr Oxenby, the conniving Edmund, Geoffrey Thornton, the ever loyal Gloucester.

Sir steps in and out of his state, as does King Lear. King Lear re-discovers himself towards the end of the play. He realises that all is lost, except perhaps for his knowledge of himself. Sir does not however, and this can also be seen as a great tragedy.

In Lear, the Fool is removed from the action during the storm scene, We are not told of what happens to him. Horman is removed from the action at the end of The Dresser, and we do not know what will happen to him. Perhaps there are two tragedies being played out in this story

You Can't Take it With You
 is a comedy and concerns the activites of a most bizarre family headed up by Martin Vanderhof, grandfather, patriarch and legally dead. The rest of the household consists of his daughter, Penny, a sometime painter and writer of unfinished plays; her husband, Paul Sycamore, who manufactures fireworks in the basement with his friend the ice delivbery man, Mr De Pinna, and their daughters, Essie and Alice. Added to this mixture is a larger than life Russian ballet tutor, a couple of very Irish servants, an agent from the Department of Internal Revenue, a former Russian Grand Duchess and a son-in-law who prints lolly wrappers with anarchial propaganda. The plot thickens when the family meets Alice's prospective in-laws (a wealthy and conservative pair) and the resulting confusion and misunderstanding leads to an hilarious, unexpected and somewhat unfortunate ending for some.

This play is about witty women - their relationship with their mothers, girlfriends, lovers. It's about commitment - to their way of life, their jobs, their friends but most of all to themselves.

Their pleasure with their surroundings turns to dread as their secrets are mysteriously revealed and horror overtakes them one, by one... by one... by one...

And Then There Were None began life as a novel in 1939. The New Statesman critic wrote: ""She stands hors concours, in a class of her own... The book must rank with Mrs Christie's previous best - on the top notch of detection.""

Displeased with the way others had dtramatized three of her novels, Agatha Christie decided to adapt this novel for the stage herself. Although this was her first stage adaptation she had written two original plays, only one of which Black Coffee the Poirot murder mystery, had been produced.

The nursery rhyme which inspired And Then There Were None necessitated a great deal of planning and Agatha Christie was pleased with the final work. For the stage adaptation she had to make one modification to the original story.

The play's debut in London in 1943 elicited this response fro W.A. Darlington of the Daily Telegraph: ""She must somehow contrive to keep you and me guessing... Well, she succeeds"". The three films made of And Then There Were None were based on the play, not the novel.

The novel's original title, Ten Little Niggers, did not offend anyone in Great Britain in 1939. In the United States, however, the term 'nigger' had been considered offensive since before the Civil War. Thus American reprints were titled Ten Little Indians, but this title is inapt since it refers to a children's counting song which is unrelated to the plot. And Then There Were None is a universally suitable title.

The Slaughter of St Teresa's Day
 Peter Kenna recalls the recent past of Sydney's underworld and of Paddington, affectionately known as 'Paddo', a tiny enclave of Victorian houses only a few miles from the centre of the city. It is often compared to London's Chelsea and New York's Greenwich. It's winding hilly streets are punctuated with art galleries, antique shops, restaurants and pubs, and among its inhabitants are many distinguished Australian artists, writers and academics - as well as trendy young people in search of Bohemia.
In the 1950s however, when
The Slaughter of St Teresa's Day
 takes place, Paddington was, for the most part, a shabby, battered place, almost a slum. With other inner suburbs, it had declined over the years as its predominantly middle-class residents moved to newer, more fashionable suburbs. The decline, which began after World War I, was accelerated by the Depression of the 1930s when one-third of the Australian workplace was unemployed. Tenants could not pay rent. Owners could not maintain 50-year old houses, with their primitive plumbing and electrical installations, their damp walls and leaky roofs. Family homes became cheap rooming houses, or warrens of tiny 'flats'.
This then was the Paddington in which Peter Kenna locates the household of his robust queen of the underworld, Oola Maguire. Oola strongly suggests a real-life underworld character of the day, Tilly Devine, whose headquarters, however, were not in Paddington but in Woolloomooloo, then another run-down suburb, almost adjacent to  Paddington, and a traditional haven of prostitutes and criminals.

The man who shaped the '20s and '30s was known to everyone in the industry simply as ""The Master"". He was the author of some of the best plays of the past 60 years - Hay Fever (1924), Bitter Sweet (1929), Private Lives (1930), Tonight at 8.30 (1936), Blithe Spirit (1941), Brief Encounter (1944).

During World War II Noel Coward was determined to make a lasting contribution to the war effort. His attempts to get an official job were unsuccessful so he turned to his own field of entertainment, which Winston Churchill had so strongly advised in the first place. Blithe Spirit was the result of that determination. Written in just five days, the play made the nation laugh and it has made nations laugh ever since.
